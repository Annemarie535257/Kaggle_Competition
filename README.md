- ‚úÖ **Production Ready**: 13,148 predictions generated for Kaggle submission

## üèó Model Architecture

```
Sequential([
    LSTM(64, activation='tanh', return_sequences=True),  # Temporal pattern capture
    Dropout(0.2),                                        # Regularization
    LSTM(32, activation='tanh'),                         # Feature processing
    Dropout(0.2),                                        # Regularization
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),                        # Non-linear transformation
    Dropout(0.1),                                        # Light regularization
    Dense(1, activation='linear')                        # Final prediction
])
```

**Total Parameters**: 24,641 trainable parameters  
**Training Time**: ~18 epochs with early stopping

## Technical Approach

### Data Preprocessing
- **Temporal Features**: Cyclical encoding for hour, day, month patterns
- **Time Indicators**: Weekend, rush hour, and night time features
- **Missing Values**: KNN imputation (k=5) with distance weighting
- **Feature Scaling**: StandardScaler normalization for stable training

### Model Design Rationale
1. **Two-Layer LSTM**: Balances complexity with training stability
2. **Dropout Regularization**: Prevents overfitting (0.2 for LSTM, 0.1 for Dense)
3. **Conservative Learning Rate**: 0.001 for stable convergence
4. **Smart Callbacks**: Early stopping and learning rate reduction
